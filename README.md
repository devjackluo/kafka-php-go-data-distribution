1. You'll want to install Wamp to host a local server
http://www.wampserver.com/en/

2. You'll also want JDK
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html

3. And you'll might want Go Lang just in case but skip for now if you want.
https://golang.org/dl/

4. Once you have Wamp installed and hopefully running (if not, check issue with port 80 being taken), 
you'll want to download this repository and put in inside your Wamp folder
